Y-COMBINATOR 1-MINUTE PITCH SCRIPT
LABEL LIE DETECTOR
===================================

[0:00 - 0:15] THE PROBLEM
"Every day, millions of people scan food labels trying to eat healthier. But here's the problem: 67% of food products make misleading health claims. Terms like 'natural,' 'wholesome,' and 'healthy' are unregulated marketing fluff. The average consumer spends 8 seconds reading a label and has no idea what half the ingredients actually do to their body."

[0:15 - 0:30] THE SOLUTION
"That's why we built Label Lie Detector. Point your phone at any food label, and in seconds, we cut through the marketing BS. Our AI extracts ingredients, identifies harmful additives, and explains health impacts in plain English. Red for concerning, yellow for questionable, green for safe."

[0:30 - 0:45] THE MARKET & WHY NOW
"The health-conscious food market is $1 trillion and growing 8% annually. People want transparency, but reading labels is hard and time-consuming. With recent advances in vision AI and mobile cameras on every phone, we can finally make this instant and accessible to everyone."

[0:45 - 0:55] THE TRACTION & VISION
"We built this in 3 hours for a hackathon. It already works with any food product. Next steps: build a database of 500,000 ingredients, add personalized health profiles, and partner with grocery chains. Imagine scanning every product before it hits your cart."

[0:55 - 1:00] THE ASK
"We're Label Lie Detector. Making food transparency instant. Thank you."
